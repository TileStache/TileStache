Welcome to TileStache's documentation!
======================================
TileStache is a Python-based server application that can serve up map tiles based on rendered geographic data. You might be familiar with TileCache the venerable open source WMS server from MetaCarta. TileStache is similar, but we hope simpler and better-suited to the needs of designers and cartographers.

For an overview of the concepts present in Girder, we recommend checking out the :doc:`user-docs`.
