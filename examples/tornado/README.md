## Instructions

First install tornado

```bash
pip install tornado
```

Run this script from command line:

```bash
python server.py
```

To test if it is working either create an 'osm' map example in geojs (https://gist.github.com/dorukozturk/5ab6eceb0202115af468cb5b30523424) or simply hit this url: http://localhost:8080/geotiff/11/356/819.png
If you see an image that means it is working.
